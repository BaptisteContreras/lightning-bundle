# Lightning Symfony Bundle

A bundle for [Symfony](https://symfony.com/) applications using [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/).

This bundle provides a bridge to use [Swoole](https://www.swoole.co.uk/) with Symfony and it tries to simplify the use of Swoole concurrency.

This bundle comes with its own [Runtime](https://github.com/BaptisteContreras/lightning-runtime), [Contracts](https://github.com/BaptisteContreras/lightning-contracts) and [Implementation](https://github.com/BaptisteContreras/lightning-lib)

This project is inspired by the excellent [Laravel Octane](https://github.com/laravel/octane) and try to provide a good alternative for Symfony applications !

**Still in development**
